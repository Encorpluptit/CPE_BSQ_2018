Find the biggest square (End of project 21/04/19)

Experience in C : 2 months.

## The project _ _ _ _ _ __ _ _ _ _

You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.

The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument. The file is valid if it is respecting those constraints:

  - its first line contains the number of lines on the board (and only that),

  - “.” (representing an empty place) and “o” (representing an obstacle) are the only two characters for theother lines,

  - all of the lines are of the same length (except the first one),

  - it contains at least one line,•each line is terminated by ‘\n’.

You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.
